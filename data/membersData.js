        description: "The 30/60/10 rule is a design principle I adhere to, which recommends allocating 30% of a dominant color, 60% of a secondary color, and 10% of an accent color to achieve a balanced composition. In Figma, I selected a primary color palette that aligns with the brand identity. I applied the dominant color to key elements, while the secondary color was used to enhance text and buttons. The accent color was utilized sparingly for highlights and calls to action, ensuring it stands out without overwhelming the overall design."
